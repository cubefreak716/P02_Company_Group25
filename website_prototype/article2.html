        This week in the development blog for Valhalla, we are doing a deep dive into combat. Obviously an exciting topic, let's take a look. This is clearly a very large and important portion of the game, so it's a part of the game that is absolutely crucial to get right. Without good combat, the core gameplay loop just won't be satisfying.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        First, the part that everyone expected: when you get hit, you get hurt. When you hit an enemy, they get hurt. Simple, right? No! We are implementing a complex physics system that takes into account how hard you hit, the way in which you hit and the material your enemy is wearing to determine how much damage should be dealth. As a result, using a sword to slash someone in heavy armour will generally accomplish very little, while using a heavier weapon like an axe or hammer will have a chance to do some serious damage.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        This system obviously places more weight on the equipment system we talked about last week. If you're in heavy armour, you will be able to ignore many of the hits that come your way, which is obviously a great thing. On the other hand, you'll be slower and you'll tire faster, and if someone hits you in the ribs with a massive hammer, well you'll still be breaking some ribs.
